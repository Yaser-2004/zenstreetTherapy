## How to visit pages effectively
- The home page starts with the portfolio page: you can click on book session to proceed forward or you can click on the share icon on top of the profile to view the share possibilities.
- On clicking book session, you will be directed to the available sessions page, where you can select the package accordingly and proceed.
- On top left is the back button which is fully functional
- Now on proceeding you will be directed to therapy_modes page, where you can select the therapy mode accordingly
    #Note: Its not fully functional, its only the frontend for now
- Now on proceeding you will be directed to the Booking confirmation page: you can enter your details if you want, then click on book session to book your session

## Main Note
- The last page, i.e., if the booking is confirmed of not is based on a random number between 1 to 10 for now. 
    If the randomNumber is even then your booking is successfully done and if its odd then its 404 not found :/


- At the last you can use the back to home button to navigate back to home.
